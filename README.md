Each card is defined by a mandatory title, an optional description and the column that it belongs to.

modify a list (list data is modified when user drags and drops the cards from one list to another list),
delete a list,
search for any keywords presents on one or multiple cards. The view is able to update without reloading the whole page,
click on a card to see its description. The description should be in the same view and extend the card container. It will not open in another page or popup/modal.
Cards and columns are unique (i.e we should not see 2 cards or 2 lists with the same title).
